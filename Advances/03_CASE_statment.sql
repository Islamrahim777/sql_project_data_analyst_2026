Problem 1
From the job_postings_fact table, categorize the salaries from job postings that are data analyst jobs, and that have yearly salary information. Put salary into 3 different categories:

If the salary_year_avg is greater than or equal to $100,000, then return ‘high salary’.
If the salary_year_avg is greater than or equal to $60,000 but less than $100,000, then return ‘Standard salary.’
If the salary_year_avg is below $60,000 return ‘Low salary’.
Also, order from the highest to the lowest salaries.

Problem 2
Count the number of unique companies that offer work from home (WFH) versus those requiring work to be on-site. 
Use the job_postings_fact table to count and compare the distinct companies based on their WFH policy (job_work_from_home).

/*
Problem 3
Write a SQL query using the job_postings_fact table that returns the following columns:

job_id

salary_year_avg

experience_level (derived using a CASE WHEN)

remote_option (derived using a CASE WHEN)

Only include rows where salary_year_avg is not null.

Instructions
Experience Level
Create a new column called experience_level based on keywords in the job_title column:

Contains "Senior" → 'Senior'

Contains "Manager" or "Lead" → 'Lead/Manager'

Contains "Junior" or "Entry" → 'Junior/Entry'

Otherwise → 'Not Specified'

Use ILIKE instead of LIKE to perform case-insensitive matching (PostgreSQL-specific).

Remote Option
Create a new column called remote_option:

If job_work_from_home is true → 'Yes'

Otherwise → 'No'

Filter and Order

Filter out rows where salary_year_avg is NULL

Order the results by job_id
